# Facharbeit-Blockchain

This Repository contains a simple implementation of a Blockchain in Java. 
This Blockchain does not match a fullfunctioning Cryptocurrency or anything alike and is only meant to be 
a visualisation of the chaining principle and the hash generation with SHA256.

The code is very well commented and you can just play around with it in order to understand how the principle works.
ENJOY!
